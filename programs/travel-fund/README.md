# Travel Fund

This fund exists to support individuals who may not otherwise have the opportunity to attend in three categories.
  - Collaborators
  - Standards Participation
  - Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

The fund can cover the costs, in whole or in part, of a participant's hotel, airfare, and some event registrations.
Fund Applicants should seek to use employer funds as a first resort. Need is a factor.

Requests must be made prior to the start of travel. Requests submitted once travel is complete will not be approved.

It is strongly recommended that you submit your request far enough in advance to get approval before making relevant expenditures. Review of requests will take at least 72 hours and may take considerably longer. Note, with limited funds available, approval is not guaranteed. If a request is rejected, reimbursement will not be issued. The Foundation cannot pre-pay for travel expenditures.

## Eligibility Criteria:
* Candidates must be an active participant of one of the projects of the OpenJS Foundation.
* An active member of a project community is someone who has had recent, sustained contributions to the project during the past 90 days.
* All projects in the foundation, regardless of stage or incubation status, are eligible to use the travel fund, this includes employees of the foundation member companies as well.

## Reimbursement

Being reimbursed is a two-step process:

1. Pre-approval
2. Submitting expenses  

### Step One: Pre-Approval
Apply for pre-approval by:

   * Open a pull request in this repo to add your entry to this year's file in the ```travel-fund``` directory.
   * Include as many fields as possible:
   * The name of the event you plan to attend.
   * The location, dates of the event and where you will be traveling from.
   * The presentation you intend to give, if applicable.
   * The size of the stipend you wish to receive.
   * In the pull request description, explain how you calculated your stipend. For example, include estimates for  airfare, hotel, other transportation, and so on. The total amount should be your stipend request.
   * In the PR description, mention @openjs-foundation/cpc.
   * Once the final amount spent is known, update the table again with that information.
   * Certain details of your request (such as the column for date sent to finance) may be unknown initially; these can be filled in and updated during the process of reconciliation.

#### Who Pre-Approves
Travel requests in this category are approved by the Cross Project Council. A request is approved when all of the following criteria are met:

  * The pull request has been open for at least 72 hours.
  * The request has approval from at least four members of @openjs-foundation/cpc.
  * No members of @openjs-foundation/cpc have objected to the request.
  * The pull request has been merged. Any member may merge once other prerequisites have been met.
  If a request is blocked by an objection from a member of @openjs-foundation/cpc, then the only way for the
  request to be approved is for that committee to decide to approve the request using whatever
  decision-making process the committee uses when consensus is not reached.


  ### Step Two: Submit Expenses
After the event file your expenses using [this form](https://form.asana.com/?k=S6lGzAjHv2uv7M8llnhO_w&d=9283783873717). 

* You will need to fill out and attach these [two forms](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E-dTuqnIWpZN2NP-1ioAWzK_W2zSwa_P?usp=share_link)
* Please attach all receipts, expenses without receipts can not be paid
* Expense reports must be submitted after the event and within 30 days of the event date
* Payments are generally processed within 30 days
* You may use 3rd party software such as Expensify to create an expense report, please ensure all receipts are included and are legible on the submitted report
* Please direct any questions to operations@openjsf.org or reach out to Foundation staff on the OpenJS Foundation Slack
