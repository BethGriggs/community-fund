# Travel Fund

This fund exists to support individuals who may not otherwise have the opportunity to attend in three categories.
  - Collaborators
  - Standards Participation
  - Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

The fund can cover the costs, in whole or in part, of a participant's hotel, airfare, and some event registrations.
Fund Applicants should seek to use employer funds as a first resort. Need is a factor.

Requests must be made prior to the start of travel. Requests submitted once travel is complete will not be approved.

It is strongly recommended that you submit your request far enough in advance to get approval before making relevant expenditures. Review of requests will take at least 72 hours and may take considerably longer. Note, with limited funds available, approval is not guaranteed. If a request is rejected, reimbursement will not be issued. The Foundation cannot pre-pay for travel expenditures.

## Reimbursement

The following LFX system and instructions are not yet active. Please send an email over to operations@openjsf.org or reach out to Foundation staff on the OpenJS Foundation Slack.

All reimbursement is done though the Linux Foundation LFX Crowdfunding platform. Once your request is approved and your travel is complete you can request reimbursement by:

1. Accepted applicants file reimbursement request on [community fundâ€™s LFX site](https://community-fund.openjsf.org).
1. Reimbursements must not exceed what was approved by the committee. Any overages are the responsibility of the applicant.
1. CPC delegate approves requests in the LFX tool that match what the budget committee has approved.

    * In the PR description, mention @openjs-foundation/cpc.
    * Once the final amount spent is known, update the table again with that information.
    * Certain details of your request (such as the column for date sent to finance) may be unknown initially;
      these can be filled in and updated during the process of reconciliation.
  * Approvers:
    Travel requests in this category are approved by the Cross Project Council. A request is approved
    when all of the following criteria are met:
      * The pull request has been open for at least 72 hours.
      * The request has approval from at least four members of @openjs-foundation/cpc.
      * No members of @openjs-foundation/cpc have objected to the request.
      * The pull request has been merged. Any member may merge once other prerequisites have been met.
    If a request is blocked by an objection from a member of @openjs-foundation/cpc, then the only way for the
    request to be approved is for that committee to decide to approve the request using whatever
    decision-making process the committee uses when consensus is not reached.
